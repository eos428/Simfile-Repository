# Simfile-Repository
Hello. This is a repository for my .sm files. I'm honestly not sure what kind of intro I should post, other than that I'm just starting to my easier difficulty charts again in 1 simfile (basically, the normal/hard diffs) so expect lots of 1 chart simfiles at the beginning. I will try to update them through the next commits if/when I'm arsed to do them.

Some FAQs since you may be asking:

Q: What kind of songs do you like to chart?<br>
A: Doujin, BMS, and rhythm game songs sometimes.

Q: What's your charting style?<br>
A: From my own words - expect jacks, trills, and streams. I'm pretty anti-noodle.

Q: How long have you been charting?<br>
A: I first started like... around a decade ago I guess? Not under this name. Haven't been consistent with charting though, since it really depends on my mood, and whether I'm busy or not.

Q: Are you that kind of guy that uses different aliases for some charts?<br>
A: Yes, haha

Q: Do you plan to submit your files somewhere?<br>
A: Maybe

Q: What charting tool are you using?<br>
A: Arrow Vortex

Q: Can I reupload your files?
A: NO.

Q: Can I help out with GFX, guest charts?
A: Sure why not. Make a pull request and I'll give my response :)

Q: No .osu or .osz file?<br>
A: You can convert them yourself through Arrow Vortex.

Then there's the usual thing where I say I don't own rights to the songs, images and etc. And I guess that's it for now. Hope you enjoy what I bring for you!
